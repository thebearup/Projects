FF6 GBA Leo Patch v0.1
A very simple hack that replaces Gogo with Leo.
You should be able to recruit him either in Thamasa (WoR) or Gogo's cave.
Apply the patch using Beat patcher (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/)
Bugs/Warnings
- When recruiting Leo, his default name will still be Gogo.
- Leo's color palette will be correct on the overworld, but wrong
  in the party select and battle screens.
- Leo will "learn" magic in the same way as Gogo (not from espers, but from other
  party members).
- You can modify Leo's skills (just like Gogo). But if you replace Shock,
  you cannot reselect it.
- Gogo/Leo cannot equip swords, so if you unequip the Crystal sword, you can't
  reequip it.
